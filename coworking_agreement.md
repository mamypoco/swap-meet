# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

We will communicate closely via slack.
Mami - 3:30 - 4:30 M-F  
Makiko - 3:30 - 5:00 M-F

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

Read through the README for each wave individually first. 
Do what each can so we can share solutions for next co-working session.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*
Mami - I read slow to understand the requirments. Since this requires class component, writing my own code and share will help. I'd also need partner's idea to learn.
Makiko -I would like to understand the requirements by myself first then come up with the own solutions and then compare mine with my teammate's solutions. After that, we can refactor our code. 

## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*
Mami - I prefer receiving feedback in-person in order to get the point of it.
Makiko - I prefer to receive feedback with examples.  


## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

Mami - I want to understand the code that my partner wrote and explain my code line by line with why.
Makiko - Be able to explain my process and code clearly, and understand why and how my teammates write their code.

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*
